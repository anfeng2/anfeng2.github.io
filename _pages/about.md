Hi! Welcome to my website :) 

I am currently a student at UC Berkeley majoring in data science and computer science with an EGT of Fall 2024! I grew up in San Francisco, so I have a special fondness for foggy days. ☁︎⋅

I am passionate about using data to extract key insights and as a tool to solve real-world challenges. I find it incredibly motivating that with data, we can form decisions that can leave an impact in the world!

I also like to teach! You can find some of the classes I've taught under the Teaching Page!

In my free time, you can find me curled up in bed making the most out of my Netflix account or making some 3d origamis. 





<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
